# eth-python-script-collection
I sometimes dump ethereum-related Python scripts here, use at own risk ;)

## Overview
* `complement-calc.py`: Calculates One's and Two's complement for various bit sizes, support hex and bin output.
* `eip-checker.py`: Takes EIP number as input and returns which fork this EIP was included in (if at all). Also retrieves all other EIPs that were in this fork.
* `find-duplicates.py`: Helper for finding duplicates (files, folders, classes, functions) in a large Python project.
